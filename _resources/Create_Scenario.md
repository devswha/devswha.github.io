The RoboCup Rescue Simulation (RCRS) requires a disaster scenario to be used in simulators. The scenarios include information of the map of the disaster zone, location of rescue teams and civilians, location of urban facilities (i.e., refuge, gas station, etc.) and location fire. The role of each urban facility or rescue team and the simulation interaction when a fire occurs can be found on [this page]({{site.url }}{{site.baseurl }}/resources/RCRS/) or in [the official manual of RCRS](https://roborescue.sourceforge.io/docs/rcrs-manual.pdf). Therefore, 



## Build the map of the scenarios
In the RCRS, the simulator simulates the earthquake occurs in the city according to a specific disaster scenario. The city where the earthquake will occur can be selected from the [Open Street Map (OSM)](https://www.openstreetmap.org) because the RCRS has a program that converts maps on the OSM into maps to be used for simulation.
